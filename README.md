The aim of my project was to develop a user-friendly method for generating realistic 3D models and displaying them on smartphones using augmented reality. The only input required from the user is a short video of the desired object, which can be uploaded to the app. The project uses a modified version of Nvidia's Instant-NeRF model, along with some pre-processing steps, to improve the quality and accuracy of the reconstructed 3D models and complete it within 5 to 10 minutes.
