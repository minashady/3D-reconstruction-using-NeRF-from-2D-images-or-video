# 3D-reconstruction-using-NeRF-from-2D-images-or-video
The aim of my project was to develop a user-friendly method for generating realistic 3D models and displaying them on smartphones using augmented reality. The only input required from the user is a short video of the desired object, which can be uploaded to the app. This project uses a modified version of Nvidia's Instant-NeRF.
